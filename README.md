**Intro**
  
Project Around the U.S. was a new project that tested our skills as engineers. This site was produced as a user's profile to show the locations of places the user had visited. This project is also made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes like desktops, tablets and phone screens. Along with some of the features in this project are "Like" Buttons and image cards. Using HTML to create the webpage and CSS to modify the look of many of the components on the webpage. 

New technologies used to create this webpage include:
- flex properties
- text-overflow
- grid-template-areas
- grid-gap
- @media
- @import 


Future plans for improving the webpage would include adding information about the user. For example, a short description or caption in the profile section that lets the viewer know if these images are places he's been or wants to visit. Perhaps even a small section where viewers can contact or add a comment to the user.

  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
